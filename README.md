Space Trader

By Roland Waddilove as a Python learning exercise (https://github.com/rwaddilove/spacetrader)

I could add more features, and it may have bugs, but I've learnt enough. I'm moving on to the next project.

Travel from planet to planet buying and selling goods, but watch out for space pirates! There are many Space Trader games and I don't know who originally created it.

Ship and planet names from https://taverncrowd.com/ (great tool!)
