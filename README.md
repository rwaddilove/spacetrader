Space Trader

By Roland Waddilove as a Python learning exercise (https://github.com/rwaddilove/spacetrader)

Use it, copy it, modify it.

Travel from planet to planet buying and selling goods, but watch out for space pirates! There are many Space Trader games and I don't know who originally created it.

Ship and planet names from https://taverncrowd.com/ (great tool!)
