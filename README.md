Space Trader - Java and Python versions

By Roland Waddilove as Java and Python learning exercise (https://github.com/rwaddilove/spacetrader). The code is probably not the best - I'm just a beginner and still learning. There are probably better ways to write this.

Travel from planet to planet buying and selling goods, but watch out for space pirates! There are many Space Trader games and I don't know who originally created it.

I could add more features, and it may have bugs, but I've learnt enough. I'm moving on to the next project.

Ship and planet names from https://taverncrowd.com/ (great tool!)
